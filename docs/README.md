# SlimFace Project Documentation 🚀

Welcome to the SlimFace project! Below is a quick overview of key documentation files to get you started with data processing, training, and inference for face classification. 📸

- [Data Processing](./data/data_processing.md): Guides you through preparing datasets for training, including Kaggle downloads and custom dataset handling. 🗂️
- [Training Documentation](./training/training_doc.md): Details the training pipeline and command-line arguments for fine-tuning face classification models with PyTorch Lightning. 🧠
- [Training Test Documentation](./test/training_test_doc.md).: Instructions for running training scripts (`efficientnet`, `regnet`, `vit`) across Linux, Windows, and macOS. 💻
- [Inference Documentation](./inference/inference_doc.md): Explains how to use `inference.py` and `end2end_inference.py` for face classification and embedding validation. 🔍
- [Inference Test Documentation](./test/inference_test_doc.md): Steps to run the inference test script (`inference_test.sh`) on various platforms. ⚙️
- [Model Metrics](./docs/evaluation/comparision.md): Table comparing four models' train/validation loss and accuracy.
